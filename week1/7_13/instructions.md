## Pre-Class Setup

### Set up antigravity and github accounts

Get one year free trial of antigravity using cornell student email 

Download and install Google antigravity IDE. Set up chrome extension for antigravity. 

Sign up for github and fork this repository. 

Use of other tools may be appropriate, but need to be configured using rules, to instruct the AI to log vibe coding prompts .agent/rules/vibe-trace.md (other tools such as Github Copilot and Cursor are not configured to do this by default, and may require additional setup)

## Vibe Off 

**Project: Your Digital Vibe.** Welcome to the course! Your first task is to create a personal "About Me" page.

### The Task
Create a website that tells us who you are. It must include:
- **Name**: Your actual name, preferred name, and pronounciation. Pronouns if needed. 
- **Photo**: How can we recognize you? A photo of yourself or visual description. 
- **Bio**: A brief introduction to yourself.
- **Hobbies**: What do you do for fun?
- **Professional Section**: Your skills, interests, or career goals.

Most importantly work on the website long enough to actually create something you are proud of. Something that truly and authentically reflects you. 

### Inspiration & "Stealing"
We encourage you to look for inspiration online. Check out sites like [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com) for award-winning designs. 
> [!TIP]
> In vibe coding, the line between "stealing" and "inspiration" is thin. You are encouraged to copy structures and layouts you like. We will discuss the ethics of attribution vs. structural borrowing in class.

## Host

Once your page is ready, you need to make it live:
- **Vanilla JS/Static Pages**: Use **GitHub Pages**. Go to your repository settings > Pages and enable it for the `main` branch.
- **Frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)**: Use **Vercel**. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployment.

## Reflection

After completing your page, reflect on the process in your `deliverable_1.md` file:
1. How did vibe coding change your approach to building a website compared to traditional coding?
2. What "structural elements" did you borrow from elsewhere? Did you feel a need to attribute them?
3. What was the most surprising thing you learned about the AI tool's capabilities or limitations?
