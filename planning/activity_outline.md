# Activity Outline

| Theme | Weekday | Topic | Project/Activity | Readings | Detailed Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Vibe Coding: Gaining Control | Week 1 Monday | What is vibe coding? | Activity: Making something and submitting it on Canvas  | [Example Portfolio](week1/activity1_example/index.html) | **Project: Your Digital Vibe.** Welcome to the course. Students will set up Antigravity and GitHub. <br><br> **Task:** Create an 'About Me' page. Must include: Who you are, hobbies, and a 'Professional' section. <br><br> **The Moral Twist:** We encourage 'stealing' or copying a fellow student's or the instructor's portfolio structure. Is it plagiarism if you vibe code it? Discuss attribution vs. inspiration. <br><br> **Deliverable:** Link to hosted GitHub Page and a Reflection in the vibe log. |
|  | Week 1 Tuesday | Prompt Engineering | Activity: Test different prompts and compare outcomes | [Why Johnny Can’t Prompt](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581388) | Compare different vibe coding tools and prompt strategies. |
|  | Week 1 Wednesday | Bias in vibe coding  | Activity: Test different tools and compare outcomes |  | Test e.g., vibe code app |
|  | Week 1 Thursday | Project Day | Project: How to vibe code? Make something that you want/need |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Ethics: Doing the right thing | Week 2 Monday | AI for good - Values in Technology (VAP) | Activity: Use the Values at Play framework to plan  |  |  |
|  | Week 2 Tuesday | AI safety | Activity: Test the limits of the technology (push it to do risky things) |  |  |
|  | Week 2 Wednesday | AI against AI  | Activity: Use AI against AI harms (e.g., AI for privacy protection) |  |  |
|  | Week 2 Thursday | Project Day | Project: Make something that purposefully supports a human value |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Outcomes: Designing systems that are useful and empowering | Week 3 Monday | Understanding users (UCD - HCD) | Activity: Split the class into 2; the first half will so live user evaluation, development, and validation |  | Note: user-centered design, vs. human and humanity-centered. What do people *need* from technology? |
|  | Week 3 Tuesday | Validation and testing (VAP) | Activity: The same activity as the previous day, but the groups will switch |  | Note: Either user testing, or a more value-centered verification process (did the technology achieve the value)  |
| Final Project | Week 3 Wednesday | Working Day | Final project working day |  |  |
|  | Week 3 Thursday | Final Project Presentations | Project: Make something that benefits someone else, and society benefits from even after class |  |  |
