# **COURSE PREFIX & COURSE NUMBER: Good Code, Good Vibes: Building Ethical Apps with AI**

#### \[Summer 2026\]

**Instructor(s):** Hauke Sandhaus, Jonathan Segal, Wendy Ju

**Meeting Time(s) and Location(s):** Monday- Thursday, July 13, 2026 to July 30, 2026

**Credits and Grading: EX:** 1, Letter Grade-Only

**Course Description:** These days, you can build apps with AI tools with the push of a button... but should you? In this three-week course, you will learn to "vibe code" real applications in an ethical manner. We will explore bias in AI systems, test the limits and vulnerabilities of these tools, and perform hands-on design while centering human values. No programming experience is required; just bring your laptop, your questions about what "AI for good" really means, and your appetite for creative problem-solving. Join us to learn not only how to build applications quickly, but also how to build them right.

**Course Objectives/Learning Outcomes:**

* Understand how AI-assisted coding tools work, including their strengths, limitations, and common failures.  
* Identify and analyze bias and risks in AI systems and generated outputs.  
* Design and build simple applications using AI tools.  
* Evaluate AI-generated code for accuracy and reliability.  
* Explain the social and ethical implications of their design decisions and how technology can support positive impact.

**Course Frequency:** Offered Summer 2026

**Textbook(s) and/or Other Required Materials:**  Personal Laptops, a digital version of [Values at Play by Flanagan and Nissenbaum](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fTIg05HNcARYP5JrEJ87KC29D2QAgqM/view?usp=drive_link) will be provided.

**Assignments, Exams, and Projects:**   
Please provide a detailed overview of projects, assignments, and other deliverables due for your class. Include percentages of how much each item allocates for the overall final class course grade.

| Activity | Overview | Point Values |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| In-Class Participation | This is an interactive class, and students are expected to contribute to the discussion, ask questions about the content, and fully engage with the material. | 10% |
| Project/Activities (1-5) | Students will complete in-class activities in class (individually or small groups, depending on the activity) and then reflect on these activities and turn in both the project and write-up. | 70%. Projects and write-ups will be due in class after the project is done in class. |
| Final Project/Presentation | Final projects will consist of students working in small groups to complete a final in-class activity and create a presentation to present to the class. | 20%. Presentations will be on the final day of class. |

**Typical Topics Covered:**  
Please provide at least three major topics that students will learn and discuss. These refer to the main subjects and themes that will be explored. Examples might include key concepts, theories, practices, and case studies relevant to the course's focus area.

* AI-assisted prototyping and development  
  * Vibe Coding tools  
  * Prompt engineering  
* Ethics in Design  
  * Values at Play Framework  
  * User Centered Design

**Method of Assessing Student Achievement:**  
**Please provide a rubric of how grades are assessed for each activity:**

Project Rubric:

| Component | Grade Percentage |
| :---- | :---- |
| Good Vibes: Novelty of Concept/Exploration of design space. Planning ahead, how convincing is the argument that you should build it? | 20% |
| Good Code: Functionality of the system and technical execution. Execution, how well have you built it? | 20% |
| Live demo: test with users (class mates), Plan, execution, and documentation of iterative test of design and system with users, to understand the system's limitations and broader impacts | 15% |
| Deep Ethical Reflection (AI writing impermissible, except for grammar checking) | 25% |
| Communication/Documentation of Ideas and Process: Text, video, and photo of the project illustrating the system capability and documenting plans and process | 20% |

**Academic Integrity**  
All students should abide by the [Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity](https://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/dean/academic-integrity/code-of-academic-integrity/), and all writing submitted should be one’s own writing. While discussing course concepts with other students is highly encouraged, and the course makes heavy use of AI for the vibe coding components plagiarism (including the use of unattributed AI tools such as ChatGPT for writing) will result in zero credit and/or a referral to the Office of Student & Academic Affairs. Please reach out if you have any additional questions about what is or is not permitted. 

**Academic Misconduct**  
A faculty member may impose a grade penalty for any misconduct in the classroom or examination room. Examples of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, talking during an exam, bringing unauthorized materials into the exam room, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.

**Students with Disabilities**  
Your access in this course is important to us. Please give us your Student Disability Services (SDS) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you need immediate accommodations for equal access, please speak with us after class or send an email message to us and/or SDS at [sds\_cu@cornell.edu](mailto:sds_cu@cornell.edu). If the need arises for additional accommodations during the semester, please contact SDS. You may also feel free to speak with the Student & Academic Affairs team at Cornell Tech who will connect you with the university SDS office. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Student Disability Services for a confidential discussion: [sds\_cu@cornell.edu](mailto:sds_cu@cornell.edu), 607-254-4545, [sds.cornell.edu](http://sds.cornell.edu). **You must request your [SDS accommodation letter](https://sds.cornell.edu/accommodations-services/academic/requesting-accommodation-letters) no later than 3 weeks prior to needing it.**

- Students currently registered with SDS: Once you request your accommodation letter and it is approved by SDS, it will be emailed to both you and your instructors. Processing time can be up to 48-hours.   
- Students not registered with SDS: The registration process for new accommodations can take up to three weeks. Once you are approved by SDS for accommodations, you will be able to request your accommodation letter for this course.  
- If you are approved for accommodations later in the semester: you must request your accommodation letter as soon as possible.

**Mental Health & Well-being**   
Your health and wellbeing are important to us, and you should always feel free to reach out to us for support. There are services and resources at Cornell designed specifically to bolster student mental health and well-being. Remember, your mental health and emotional well-being are just as important as your physical health. If you or a friend are struggling emotionally or feeling stressed, fatigued, or burned out, there are many campus resources available to you:

Cornell Tech students: This link provides a list of resources for Cornell Tech students: https://mentalhealth.cornell.edu/get-support/tech. You can additionally also contact studentwellness@tech.cornell.edu with concerns.

**Religious Observances**  
Cornell University is committed to supporting students who wish to practice their religious beliefs. Students are advised to discuss religious absences with their instructors well in advance of the religious holiday so that arrangements for making up work can be resolved before the absence. Students are encouraged to anticipate their religious/spiritual needs early in the semester, and at least two weeks before the observance, leaving plenty of time for the professor and student to reach a reasonable accommodation.
